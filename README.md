# Playing Battleships in the browser

This time we are going to improve on our battleships game. 
In [the last project](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/battle_ships.md) we implemented the battleships game for the terminal. 

Whilst interacting with the computer on the terminal is an essential skill for us developer types, it is far from the preferred way to interact with your computer for people in general. When was the last time you checked your calendar on the terminal? **Exactly!**

Nowadays applications are much richer in colours and interactions, they feel smoother and friendlier that the terminal does.

The web offers a wonderful plethora of technologies and possibilities to build applications. It's time for us to look into web technologies and play with them.

**How about being able to  play battleships on the browser?**

How to Play:

Battleships (or Battleship) is a game where each player has a board upon which they can place a number of ships. The boards are 10x10 two dimensional grid.

After each player has placed their ships on their own board they take turns to shoot on the opponents board. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a hit they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own tracking grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.

When all of one player's ships have been hit the game finishes and the player who has ships remaining is the winner.
