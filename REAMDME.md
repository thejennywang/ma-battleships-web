# Playing Battleships in the browser

This time we are going to improve on our battleships game. 
In [the last project](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/battle_ships.md) we implemented the battleships game for the terminal. 

Whilst interacting with the computer on the terminal is an essential skill for us developer types, it is far from the preferred way to interact with your computer for people in general. When was the last time you checked your calendar on the terminal? **Exactly!**

Nowadays applications are much richer in colours and interactions, they feel smoother and friendlier that the terminal does.

The web offers a wonderful plethora of technologies and possibilities to build applications. It's time for us to look into web technologies and play with them.

**How about being able to  play battleships on the browser?**
